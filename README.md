# Zelig-DAT3-Project
Dataset, Code and other materials for Zelig's DAT3 Project

Note: This repository will be for information, materials, datasets, code etc. for Zelig Dhi Lee's DAT3 Project, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Data Science (Part-Time) Course at General Assembly (Singapore), Mar - May 2017.

Title: Understanding Volcanic Eruptions through Machine Learning methodologies, 1960 - present.

Why: Massive volcanic eruptions have occured resulting in damage, loss of life, changes to environments etc which are difficult to anticipate. Through using relevant methodologies such as clustering, time series models etc, we hope to help stakeholder groups better predict future volcanic eruptions and its corrresponding effects. This will be helpful for policymakers, government agencies, NGOs, healthcare, first responsder groups etc. when planning resources for disaster / emergency preparedness.

Dataset of interest: We will be using datasets on volcanic eruptions courtesy of the Smithsonsian Institution - National Museum of Natural History Global Volcanism Program. (http://volcano.si.edu/) We have downloaded the datasets from the website. We may also look at other potential data, such as fatalities, cost of damage etc if available from other sources, but may be time consuming considering the significant scale of the dataset of eruptions.

Data exploration done: The Smithsonsian Institution has created a time-lapse of historical eruptions through geospatial methods. (http://volcano.si.edu/E3/) For the purpose of this project, we will not replicate what has been done, but to instead create hypotethetical models based on these historical info.

Proposed methodologies: (1) Simple Data exploration by continent, time, (2) Simple linear / logistic regression of SO2 emisssions against other factors, such as Volcano magnitude (3) Clustering by longtitude / latitude, magnitude, time (4) Lastly - Time-Series Models to predict future volcanic eruptions
